# T15-checkpoints-fork-rollback — Checkpoints, fork, rollback

## Goal

Session tree/checkpoints UI.

## Context docs

- `docs/01-technical-requirements.md`
- `docs/02-screen-specification.md`
- `docs/11-definition-of-done.md`

## Inputs / files to inspect first

- `app-starter/src/features/checkpoints`

## Implementation rules

- Do not make unrelated rewrites.
- Keep TypeScript strict.
- Use shared contracts from `packages/contracts` for DTOs.
- For UI work, implement loading, empty, error, and success states where applicable.
- For backend writable flows, never write into main checkout; use task worktree policy.
- Add tests for new behavior or state why a test is not practical yet.

## Acceptance checks

- [ ] Checkpoint list/tree.
- [ ] Fork/rollback payload includes checkpoint id.
- [ ] Rollback creates new task wording.

## Verification commands

```bash
pnpm --filter mobile test -- checkpoints
pnpm --filter mobile typecheck
```
