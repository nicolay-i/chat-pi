# T07-projects-screens — Projects screens

## Goal

Projects list, create/edit project, project dashboard.

## Context docs

- `docs/01-technical-requirements.md`
- `docs/02-screen-specification.md`
- `docs/11-definition-of-done.md`

## Inputs / files to inspect first

- `app-starter/app/projects`
- `app-starter/src/features/projects`

## Implementation rules

- Do not make unrelated rewrites.
- Keep TypeScript strict.
- Use shared contracts from `packages/contracts` for DTOs.
- For UI work, implement loading, empty, error, and success states where applicable.
- For backend writable flows, never write into main checkout; use task worktree policy.
- Add tests for new behavior or state why a test is not practical yet.

## Acceptance checks

- [ ] Empty/loading/error states.
- [ ] Repo validation UI.
- [ ] Dashboard separates chats/tasks.

## Verification commands

```bash
pnpm --filter mobile test -- projects
pnpm --filter mobile typecheck
```
